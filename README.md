# 🌳 GREN - Making Lifestyle Sustainable 🌎

## 💡Inspiration
_Stat:_ <br/> 
👉 Mother nature is already taking hits from the poor choices of us human beings where we leave behind Carbon Footprints from the food we consume to the Toilet paper we use. <br/>
👉 Do you know? Just one liter of Coke costs us **346 gm** of Carbon Dioxide from manufacture to our refrigerator and Mega roll of Ultra Smooth Toilet paper leaves **771 gm** CO2… Yes! Twice than Coke.  <br/>
<br/>
_Survey:_ <br/> 
👉 Figures like these ignited curiosity and got us thinking if Big MNCs are adopting low Carbon goods then why can’t we?  <br/>
👉 On doing a quick local survey we found out 7 in 10 people didn’t know about alternatives at all or where to buy them. <br/>
<br/>
_Approach:_ <br/> 
👉 So we Solved this exact problem by introducing our product **GREN -  Making Lifestyle Sustainable** <br/>

## ♻️ What it does
**GREN** provides a one-stop solution for all the daily needs by suggesting eco alternatives based on the product's Carbon Footprint while promoting Recycling of Waste.
<br/><br/>
**We have the following features:** <br/>
1. Product listings with their Carbon Footprint UI for a better choice <br/>
2. ECO IMPACT description to let the user know about the impact on the environment <br/>
3. **Alternative** ECO Product Suggestion with comparison

## 🛠️ How we built it
**Ideation** <br/>
👉 Each member put forward their perspective and we collectively brainstormed towards the solution using flashcards and micro pitching. <br/><br/>
**Extension** <br/>
👉 We build a browser extension that integrates with the E-commerce sites and provides description about products. <br/><br/>
**Deep Learning Model** <br/>
👉 We used Xception Net CNN architecture to perform Product Recognition.
